<h2 align="center">Vocabulary</h2>

- __command__ - an action triggered by a user e.g. via DOM event
- __component__ - a pure function which returns an instance of Virtual DOM and can be reused across multiple projects
- __layout__ - a function which the only role is to lay down slots, hence it does not have access to the store, nor commands
- __provider__ - an action executed prior rendering which provide initial data and make those actions pipe the store through
- __reusable slot__ - a piece of UI to be reused across pages within an app which has read access to the store and, may trigger commands
- __slot__ - a logically separated UI section which have read access to the store and, may trigger commands
- __store__ - a central app state

<h2 align="center">App state flow</h2>

There is a uni-directional app state flow which populates a single store. See example below.

1. The app is bootstrapping.
2. Providers are triggered piping through the store. Each of them writes to the store by resolving or returning. (result of `getTodos` is passed to `getFilteredTodos`).
3. Last Provider in the pipeline (`getFilteredTodos`) stores its result and triggers rendering.
4. Rendering layer passes the store as `actionResults` and Commands as `actions`.
5. User types in a filter string which triggers a Command (`filterTodos`).
6. Command: `filterTodos` writes to the store and triggers rendering.
7. Core Command: `reload` re-triggers whole cycle.

<h2 align="center">Rendering</h2>

Every time a Command is triggered, Virtual DOM performs full-page re-render to give all Slots read access to the Command result via Store.
 
There is a core 'reload' Command to re-trigger Providers and then perform re-rendering. 
It's meant to be called right after the Command handling particular app event resolved (usually it happens in DOM event handler).
Since Providers pipe through the store, after 'reload', they may access result of the Command.  

<h2 align="center">Components</h2>

Slots are not Components. Components are pure functions which receive immutable, non-app specific props.
